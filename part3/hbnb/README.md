## 📄 <span id="description">Description</span>

This project features a well-organized structure across the Presentation, Business Logic, and Persistence layers. It is built using Flask and prepares the architecture for future integration of API endpoints and a database-backed persistence layer.

The application utilizes the Facade design pattern to manage communication between the Presentation, Business Logic, and Persistence layers. Currently, an in-memory repository handles object storage and validation, which will act as a placeholder until it is replaced by a database-backed solution using SQLAlchemy in later stages.

## 📂 <span id="files-description">Files description</span>

# 🧪 HBnB API Testing Guide

This section describes how to run unit tests and perform manual testing using `curl` for your Flask REST API.

---

## 🧪 Running Unit Tests

### ✅ Run All Tests

Make sure your virtual environment is activated and the `PYTHONPATH` is set:

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$(pwd)/part2/hbnb
python3 -m unittest discover part2/hbnb/tests
```

Expected result:

```
Ran 15 tests in 0.039s
OK
```

---

## 🚀 Start the Flask API Server

Before using `curl`, run your Flask API server:

```bash
cd part2/hbnb
python3 app.py
```

Make sure it is running at:

```
http://localhost:5000
```

Swagger documentation is available at:

```
http://localhost:5000/api/v1/
```

---

## 🧪 Manual Testing with curl

### 1️⃣ Create a User

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/v1/users/ \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "first_name": "Claire",
  "last_name": "Obscure",
  "email": "claire@example.com"
}'
```

---

### 2️⃣ Create an Amenity

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/v1/amenities/ \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"name": "WiFi"}'
```

Repeat for other amenities like `"Air Conditioning"`, `"Parking"`, etc.

🔍 List amenities and retrieve their IDs:

```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/v1/amenities/
```

---

### 3️⃣ Create a Place  
*(Use a valid `user_id` and `amenity` IDs)*

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/v1/places/ \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "title": "Charming Loft",
  "description": "A cozy loft in the city center",
  "price": 120.5,
  "latitude": 48.8566,
  "longitude": 2.3522,
  "owner_id": "USER_ID",
  "amenities": ["AMENITY_ID_1", "AMENITY_ID_2"]
}'
```

---

### 4️⃣ Create a Review

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/v1/reviews/ \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "text": "Great location and clean space!",
  "rating": 5,
  "user_id": "USER_ID",
  "place_id": "PLACE_ID"
}'
```

---

## 📖 Additional GET Examples

### List all users

```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/v1/users/
```

### Get a user by ID

```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/v1/users/<user_id>
```

### List all places

```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/v1/places/
```

curl http://localhost:5000/api/v1/reviews/places/<place_id>/reviews
```

## ✅ Testing Summary

| **Test Type** | **Description** | **Command / URL** |
|:-------------:|----------------|-------------------|
| Unit Tests | Run Python unittest suite | `python3 -m unittest discover part2/hbnb/tests` |
| Manual API Test | Run server & use curl requests | `curl -X ...` |
| API Documentation | Swagger (Flask-RESTx auto-generated) | `http://localhost:5000/api/v1/` |

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- A `User` must exist before creating a `Place`.
- A `User` and `Place` must exist before creating a `Review`.
- `Amenity` IDs must exist before attaching them to a `Place`.
- Make sure related resources exist before linking them together.
- All endpoints return appropriate HTTP status codes (`200`, `201`, `400`, `404`, etc.).

## 🔧 <span id="whats-next">What's next?</span>

- Integration of functional API endpoints within the `api/` directory.
- Full implementation of the Business logic in the `models/` directory and Facade class.
- Replacement of the in-memory repository with a database-backed persistence layer using SQL Alchemy.
